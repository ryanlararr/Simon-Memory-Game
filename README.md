### Overview
This application utilizes the [Nana C++ GUI library](http://nanapro.org/en-us/ "Nana C++ GUI library") to simulate the [Simon memory game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4). Random colors are generated building a sequence for the user to repeat until failure. Each button has a distinct sound upon press, and the player is met with an error sound on an incorrect input.

#### Initial game menu
The initial game menu consists of 4 colored buttons surrounding a
start button in the middle - similar to an actual Simon console.

####  End Game Menu
Once the user presses the wrong color in the sequence or takes longer than 5 seconds to press a button, the menu displays their score and gives the option to restart the game or quit the application.
